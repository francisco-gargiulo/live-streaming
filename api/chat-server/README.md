# Socket.IO Chat Server

This is a simple chat server built using Socket.IO and Node.js. It allows multiple users to communicate with each other in real-time by sending messages to the chat room. The server uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.

## Installation

To install and run the server, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm on your system.
2. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/example/socketio-chat-server.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory using the command `cd socketio-chat-server`.
4. Install dependencies using the command `npm install`.
5. Start the server by running the command `JWT_SECRET=s3cr3t npm start`.

## Usage

The server supports the following Socket.IO events:

### Server Events

- `load`: This event is emitted when a new client connects to the server. The server sends the current chat messages to the client in response.

- `error`: This event is emitted when an error occurs. The error is sent as a JSON object with a `code` property and an optional `message` property.

### Client Events

- `message`: This event is emitted when the user sends a message to the chat room. The message should be sent as a JSON object with a `message` property.

To use the server, clients can connect to it using Socket.IO client libraries for various programming languages or platforms. The clients can send messages to the server using the `message` event and receive messages from the server using the `load` event. Clients must authenticate and authorize themselves by sending a JWT token with every request to the server.

## Client

Here is an example of how to use the Socket.IO client in JavaScript to connect to the server and send a chat message:

```javascript
// Import the Socket.IO client library
import io from 'socket.io-client';

// Connect to the server using a JWT token for authentication and authorization
const socket = io('https://example.com', {
  auth: {
    token: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c',
  }
});

// Send a chat message to the server
socket.emit('message', { message: 'Hello, world!' });

// Listen for new chat messages from the server
socket.on('load', (data) => {
  console.log('Received new chat message:', data);
});
```

## Security

This chat server uses JWT tokens to authenticate and authorize users. It is important to keep the JWT_SECRET environment variable secure, as it is used to sign and verify the JWT tokens. In addition, the server should be run over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.
